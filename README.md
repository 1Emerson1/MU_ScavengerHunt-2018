# Code Scavenger Hunt

#### Monmouth University: Code Scavenger Hunt

---

## Description
The CSSE department at Monmouth University created a scavenger hunt for its students. An initial challenge is given and if completed correctly, it will yield a hint for the next challenge. All of the challenges are meant to be completed using Java and fundamentals taught up to CS-176.

All the challenges and its intructions will be gathered in this repo.

## Challenges
There were three challenges that become more diffcult after one another. Below you will find a short description of each challenge.

### Challenge 1
The first challenge is to decypher a message using an alaphabet array. The second position of the array must contain ***a*** and so on. Each number represents an index and should be replaced with its respective value from the array.

### Challenge 2
The second challenge uses Java's shape libraries to render the next clue. Specific instructions were given to properly draw the room number where the hint resides. Said instructions can be found in the repo.

### Challenge 3
The final challenge entailed creating a secret message from text of literature and methods to extract specific words. If done correctly, the secret message will be revealed. The instructions can also be found in the repo. 

## Usage
An executable ***.jar*** file was not created. If you want to run the programs, you will have to clone the repo and compiled.

## Credits
The program was created using the provided instructions by Emerson Hidalgo.
