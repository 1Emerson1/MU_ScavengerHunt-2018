[32m+[m[32mOne morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found[m
[32m+[m[32mhimself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin.  He lay on[m
[32m+[m[32mhis armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could[m
[32m+[m[32msee his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff[m
[32m+[m[32msections.  The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready[m
[32m+[m[32mto slide off any moment.  His many legs, pitifully thin compared[m
[32m+[m[32mwith the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he[m
[32m+[m[32mlooked.[m
[32m+[m
[32m+[m[32m"What's happened to me?" he thought.  It wasn't a dream.  His room,[m
[32m+[m[32ma proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully[m
[32m+[m[32mbetween its four familiar walls.  A collection of textile samples[m
[32m+[m[32mlay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and[m
[32m+[m[32mabove it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an[m
[32m+[m[32millustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame.  It showed[m
[32m+[m[32ma lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright,[m
[32m+[m[32mraising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm[m
[32m+[m[32mtowards the viewer.[m
[32m+[m
[32m+[m[32mGregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather.[m
[32m+[m[32mDrops of rain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel[m
[32m+[m[32mquite sad.  "How about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all[m
[32m+[m[32mthis nonsense", he thought, but that was something he was unable to[m
[32m+[m[32mdo because he was used to sleeping on his right, and in his present[m
[32m+[m[32mstate couldn't get into that position.  However hard he threw[m
[32m+[m[32mhimself onto his right, he always rolled back to where he was.  He[m
[32m+[m[32mmust have tried it a hundred times, shut his eyes so that he[m
[32m+[m[32mwouldn't have to look at the floundering legs, and only stopped when[m
[32m+[m[32mhe began to feel a mild, dull pain there that he had never felt[m
[32m+[m[32mbefore.[m
[32m+[m
[32m+[m[32m"Oh, God", he thought, "what a strenuous career it is that I've[m
[32m+[m[32mchosen! Travelling day in and day out.  Doing business like this[m
[32m+[m[32mtakes much more effort than doing your own business at home, and on[m
[32m+[m[32mtop of that there's the curse of travelling, worries about making[m
[32m+[m[32mtrain connections, bad and irregular food, contact with different[m
[32m+[m[32mpeople all the time so that you can never get to know anyone or[m
[32m+[m[32mbecome friendly with them.  It can all go to Hell!"  He felt a[m
[32m+[m[32mslight itch up on his belly; pushed himself slowly up on his back[m
[32m+[m[32mtowards the headboard so that he could lift his head better; found[m
[32m+[m[32mwhere the itch was, and saw that it was covered with lots of little[m
[32m+[m[32mwhite spots which he didn't know what to make of; and when he tried[m
[32m+[m[32mto feel the place with one of his legs he drew it quickly back[m
[32m+[m[32mbecause as soon as he touched it he was overcome by a cold shudder.[m
[32m+[m
[32m+[m[32mHe slid back into his former position.  "Getting up early all the[m
[32m+[m[32mtime", he thought, "it makes you stupid.  You've got to get enough[m
[32m+[m[32msleep.  Other travelling salesmen live a life of luxury.  For[m
